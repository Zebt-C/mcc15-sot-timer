# MCC 15th Anniversary Sands of Time themed Timer



## About this app

This app takes inspiration from a [video](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV19Dv4ejEuf/)(on Bilibili, Simplified Chinese) that demonstrates a desktop timer app with Sands of Time,  a minigame featured in [MCC 15th Anniversary Party](https://minecraft.wiki/w/MCC_x_Minecraft_15th_Anniversary_Party) event server. It is a rework using [Godot Game Engine](https://godotengine.org/).

**Features of this app**:

- A simple timer that pops up at the top-center of the screen
- Prompt tones that play when 30, 20, 10 or below seconds remain
- Iconic Sands of Time music that plays during countdown
- Relaxing Hub music that plays during timer setup
